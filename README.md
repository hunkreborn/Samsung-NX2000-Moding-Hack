# Samsung-NX2000-Moding-Hack

This is a hacking mod for Samsung NX2000. Since this camera has no buttons, its not possible to enter the Developer Menu by keypress.

I give NO warranty of success, it works in my camera, may not work in yours. 
I take NO responsibility for deleting your photos and movies, brick your camera or any problem whatsoever.

Device Support
Supported models:

Samsung NX2000 (Version 1.18)

This tutorial was inspired by "ge0rg's NX300 Hacking", take a look there since its much more technical than mine. 

I started by checking his steps and then made the list of codes for each function that I wanted to disable/enable that are available in the Developer Menu, but unfortunately NX2000 has no such menu, or if it does, its only achievable thru hacking or some keystrokes macro script that I'm unware of. 

Check those links before starting if you haven't yet.
